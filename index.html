            <p class="c1_text">The artifact used is an Inventory app developed using Android Studio, Java, and SQLite. It was created in the CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming class. The purpose of the app is to allow users to store products and their respective quantities in a database to manage inventory. I am converting the app into a Biological Sample Inventory System. This app will store biological samples in a database and include extra features such as a search function, data visualization, and exporting data into files. This artifact was chosen because although the final project was completed in the class, there was room for improvement. An inventory app can be modified for many purposes, and in the field of bioinformatics, gathering samples in a secure and efficient manner is useful for researchers and other scientists. <br><br>
            The architecture seen in the enhancement is the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, which improves the application's design by separating the UI from the program's logic. The folder structure was reorganized to improve the organization of files, including the activities, as well as the adapter, utils, and viewholder packages, which are part of the RecyclerView list implementation. The addition of search functionality and allowing users to select items from the list is done through the RecyclerView structure. Other features added to enhance the application include data visualization via a pie chart and the ability to export data in CSV format. <br><br>
            The enhancements completed thus far cover all course outcomes. Key areas addressed include database implementation, computational solutions through the use of different algorithms and tools, and structural adjustments, such as using RecyclerView and LiveData, which enhance the design and resolve technical issues. Additionally, algorithms have been improved for gathering and storing data, such as filtering and searching for specific samples. Security and role-based access are implemented through proper registration mechanisms. Adding a search feature will be very useful for users when looking for a sample in a large dataset. The export to CSV feature could also be beneficial for research purposes in the bioinformatics field. Modifications to the app's build and dependencies were necessary to incorporate pie chart visualization into the application. <br><br>
            Overall, the process has been educational, informative, and somewhat time-consuming. Some new skills that had to be researched included exporting to CSV files, search implementation, and importing a new dependency to visualize data with a pie chart. In addition to these new techniques, new components were added to the application, such as a dropdown menu, a menu bar, and a calendar selection. Many new features and skills were incorporated, and I found that much more research was needed than I had originally anticipated. Time was also spent debugging some newly added features, which was challenging. For example, the search feature was initially difficult because I wanted users to be able to search by sample name, type, or species. This required adjusting the query for filtering to include all fields and iterating over all data for samples that match the search criteria into a LiveData array. Achieving the desired functionality involved research and multiple iterations; however, the functionality can now be viewed in the Database Helper. Additionally, warnings from the original artifact were addressed, and the file structure was adjusted to further enhance the application.
